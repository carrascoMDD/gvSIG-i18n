gvSIG-i18n RELEASE NOTES
========================


version 2.1.4

Bug fix: Restored tool method fElaborarInformeModulos, that was accidentally removed in previous release.


|
|

------------------------------------------------

version 2.1.4

Addition: Added 2011 year to the copyright notice to files generated by ArchGenXML.
Addition: Translations page: Added to confirmation dialogs a message indicating that the user may disable the confirmation dialogs with a check box in the Options section.
Bug fix:  Fixed bug in TRACatalogo_Retrieval methods to access the first collection of a certain type, which failed when no collections were present, causing a failure when deleting a translations catalog.
Bug fix:  When loading translations interchange contents from GNU gettext .POT files, if no Default string is supplied in the entry, the symbol for the entry is used as the translation for the default language (usually [en]).
Change:   When loading translations interchange contents from a .zip archive, the entries are created under the TRAImportacion element, in the same order as the files read (previously the entries were created sorted by language, then module).
Change:   Make most String and Text fields non-searcheable - except description and text, to avoid excessive growth of main database (Data.fs), because of the growth of portal_catalog. Specifically, the text field holding translations interchange content impact heavily on Data.fs, while they shouldn't.
Change:   In Translations catalog root page, display contributing users in as few lines as possible. (previously, each user displayed in a separate line).

|

------------------------------------------------

version 2.1.3

Fixed bug: In the translations page, when enabled the option to show the status change buttons, for batch mode, when hiding or dusplaying the symbols column, and displaying or hiding the columns in a row over the translations, the grid looses its proper arrangement, because some cells are not properly hidden or shown. 
Addition: Translations page now show the string sources (files where the string is used) in the editor details. String sources field now added to TRATraduccion, and to the metadata held in indexes to search for TRATraduccion.
Addition: When unauthorized users request the rendering of a Status Report (Summary by Languages, or by Modules and Languages) or Activity Report, ths system informe the user that he/she has no permission to generate the report.
Addition: The rendering of a Status Report (Summary by Languages, or by Modules and Languages) or Activity Report, now includes a hyperlink to the last Status (or Contributions) Report.
Addition: Status Reports now present two distinct views, to display the Summary Report by Languages and other for the Report by Modules and Languages. The Tabular view of the Report no longer embeds the presentatios of these two reports, but rather ender a hyperlink to visit the specific report view.
Addition: Initial page of translations catalog now presents the contributing users and administrators of the catalog.

|
|

------------------------------------------------

version 2.1.2

Fixed bug: No Activity Report is presented to Users, like Anonymous, that are not permitted to ellaborate an up-to-date Activity Report, when the existing Activity Report is obsolete or none exists.
Addition: In the translations page, when the user requests to hide the left-side column with symbols, then rows with the symbol are added on top of each translation.


|
|


------------------------------------------------

|
|

version 2.1.1

Addition: Translations Page.Options: added options to control whether actions should be protected by confirmation dialogs for translation changes, status changes and translation deletions.

Addition: Translations Page.Options: added headers to highlight the two distinct sections of the options: the ones that do not require refreshing the page for them to take effect, and the ones that require refreshing the page.

Addition: Translations Page.Options: moved the option to control Asynchronous or asynchronous mode to the bottoms of the sub-section of options that do not require refeshing the page to take effect. This options is less relevant to normal users than other options ofo the sub-section.

Addition: Translations Page.History: display for each translation, all its history records, in a collapsible section, most recent first.

Optimization: Translations Page: localizations of all internationalized strings are retreived with a single framework invocation.

Fixed bug: Contributions Progress Results page: added 'Tabular/' at the end of the URL of the link to the resulting Contributions Report.

Fixed bug: The history records did record the actor user id in place of the the translated string. Now the translations correcly record the translated string.

version 2.1RC

Added year 2011 to Copyright notice.

------------------------------------------------


|
|


version 2.0.6

Fixed bug preventing to add interchange content files to an import.

Added element type to store Contribution reports, a process to generate the report, and a view to present various slices of the contributions report.

Fixed bug preventing to use wildcards, parenthesis and double quotes in the search string when searching for Symbols or for translations.

Always include the language code in the filename of .properties export files, ignoring if the language is the main one, to avoid confussion with files named just tex.properties, which sometimes was interpreted as containing language 'es' and some others as'en'.

Added option to long-lived processes configuration to yield processor 
only at transactional boundaries (if transactions are enabled for the process).

Add to the Activity report a link to navigate to the last Contributions report. 



Known bug:
When searching for strings in both the symbol and translation, all records are returned.

Known bug:
Translation history records show the actor user rather than the translation.


Known bug:
When exporting in GNU gettext .PO format, the default entries for each translation is exported as empty, and does not include the translation in the reference language selected in the export configuration form.

Controller for long lived process, allowing pause, resume and terminate, review of intermediate results, and storage of results.
Persistent elements reflecting all performed long-lived processes.
Persistent configuration elements to control numerous aspects of the application, including the defaults for long-lived process scheduling.
Export of translations status, modules, contributing users and dates.

Summary of use cases implemented after delivery of version 1.0.0.2 (build200907281654)
======================================================================================

- The import process can now be configured to execute
  yielding processor resources at a certain frequency,
  to reduce its impact on system performance,
  avoiding adverse effects on other users experience of the site.
  
- Added Links to navigate from advanced views, 
  to the root catalog page, 
  or the corresponding translation page.


|
|


**Use Cases already reported as implemented after delivery of version 1.0 (build200907160507**


- Recipe to create and mount separate file storages for translation catalogs,
  to reduce the performance impact on other Plone content,
  of growing data files with lots of translations.
  
- Distribution of Releases shall include the dlivery of downloadable files also in .gz format.

- Users with TRADeveloper role may Create Strings requested to be translated.
  Later, user with TRACoordinator role actually incorporates the requested strings to the catalog,
  by launching a strings creation process.
  
- Users with TRACoordinator role may Create new Languages.

- Users with TRACoordinator role may Copy Translations into a Language from another Language.

- Translations exported in Java .properties format and unicode escape encoding,
  now properly escape also chars between 127 and 255.
  
- The products in support of searches in oriental languages,
  (ZopeChinaPak and CJKSplitter) are now optional,
  and the application works without them installed.
  
- Simpler security model, where there are no User Groups to manage
  user access to all languages or specific languages: 
  now the control is enforced by assigning local roles to users
  directly on the Languages, and disabling the role acquisition for the element.
  
- Users may now observe the security permission they hold on each element,
  the permissions held by key user groups in each element,
  and the specification of required permissions expected in each element type.
  
- The translations catalog can now be locked by a TRACoordinator to avoid modifications.

- The translations catalog is locked for modifications upon start of import processes,
  and is unlocked upon the process termination.

- TRACoordinator users may now specify that an import process is to be launched automatically
  when the previous one terminates.

- If an exception occurs during an import process,  
  the exception shall be displayed (on the next refresh of) the import process progress page.
  (until now, the exception appeared only in the tabular view for the import).
  
- Users shall hold the permission "gvSIGi18n: Add TRACatalogo" on container elements
  for the users to be able to create translation catalogs in the container.
  This means that the administrator must add this permission to the Plone Site,
  or to specific folder(s), to allow the creation of translation catalogs.
  
- Users can now apply Batch translation status changes with a very high number of translations.
  For example, 4000 in gvSIG 1.9 can be submitted in a single click.
  
- TRADeveloper users can now Invalidate a String translations into all languages.

- Users can now observe (or hide) the execution time profiling results for translation page synchronous requests.

- Standard Plone actions are intercepted or aliased to maintain a tight contron on application instances.

- Textual view now works, even on catalogs with languages in non latin characters.
  (previously, it used to crash).

When on Batch status change mode  clicking on a translation status submits an asynch status change rather than changing the flag on the batch status change for the translation
