Overview

  gvSIGtraducciones allows the collaborative translations
  of user interface strings from the gvSIG application
   - an open source GIS made in Java - 
   and the collaborative tools used in the gvSIG project
   - made in open source Plone.
   
   gvSIGtraducciones also allows indeed to translate
   user interface strings from any other program,
   as it imports and exports translations in both
   Java .properties format for intenationalization localized files,
   and .PO files according to GNU gettext.
