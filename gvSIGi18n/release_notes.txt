Summary of use cases implemented after delivery of version 1.0.0.2 (build200907281654)
======================================================================================

- The import process can now be configured to execute
  yielding processor resources at a certain frequency,
  to reduce its impact on system performance,
  avoiding adverse effects on other users experience of the site.
  
- Added Links to navigate from advanced views, 
  to the root catalog page, 
  or the corresponding translation page.


|
|


**Use Cases already reported as implemented after delivery of version 1.0 (build200907160507**


- Recipe to create and mount separate file storages for translation catalogs,
  to reduce the performance impact on other Plone content,
  of growing data files with lots of translations.
  
- Distribution of Releases shall include the dlivery of downloadable files also in .gz format.

- Users with TRADeveloper role may Create Strings requested to be translated.
  Later, user with TRACoordinator role actually incorporates the requested strings to the catalog,
  by launching a strings creation process.
  
- Users with TRACoordinator role may Create new Languages.

- Users with TRACoordinator role may Copy Translations into a Language from another Language.

- Translations exported in Java .properties format and unicode escape encoding,
  now properly escape also chars between 127 and 255.
  
- The products in support of searches in oriental languages,
  (ZopeChinaPak and CJKSplitter) are now optional,
  and the application works without them installed.
  
- Simpler security model, where there are no User Groups to manage
  user access to all languages or specific languages: 
  now the control is enforced by assigning local roles to users
  directly on the Languages, and disabling the role acquisition for the element.
  
- Users may now observe the security permission they hold on each element,
  the permissions held by key user groups in each element,
  and the specification of required permissions expected in each element type.
  
- The translations catalog can now be locked by a TRACoordinator to avoid modifications.

- The translations catalog is locked for modifications upon start of import processes,
  and is unlocked upon the process termination.

- TRACoordinator users may now specify that an import process is to be launched automatically
  when the previous one terminates.

- If an exception occurs during an import process,  
  the exception shall be displayed (on the next refresh of) the import process progress page.
  (until now, the exception appeared only in the tabular view for the import).
  
- Users shall hold the permission "gvSIGi18n: Add TRACatalogo" on container elements
  for the users to be able to create translation catalogs in the container.
  This means that the administrator must add this permission to the Plone Site,
  or to specific folder(s), to allow the creation of translation catalogs.
  
- Users can now apply Batch translation status changes with a very high number of translations.
  For example, 4000 in gvSIG 1.9 can be submitted in a single click.
  
- TRADeveloper users can now Invalidate a String translations into all languages.

- Users can now observe (or hide) the execution time profiling results for translation page synchronous requests.

- Standard Plone actions are intercepted or aliased to maintain a tight contron on application instances.

- Textual view now works, even on catalogs with languages in non latin characters.
  (previously, it used to crash).
